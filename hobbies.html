    <h2>Bowling</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy bowling as it is a fairly competitive atmosphere when surrounded by others who like to compete in leagues.
        <br>I got into bowling around July 2021 as it became a sufficient replacement to basketball. 
        <br> Quickly, I fell in love with being able to hone in on my craft and perfect my technique and form. 
        <br> This led me to purchasing my own bowling ball in December of 2022, and from there my passion for Bowling took off.
        <br> Here's a quick picture of me bowling!

    <h2>Valorant</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favorite things to do in my downtime is to play Valorant! Much like any other game it is extremely addictive.
        <br>Something to frown upon is the immense amount of money I've spent on the game, which comes out to a grand total of
        <br>around $2,000+. However, I did peak Diamond 1 in November of 2022, but took a 3 month hiatus away from the game.

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
        I would say coding is more of a passion than a hobby. My first experience with coding actually came in my Senior year
        <br> of highschool when I took an AP Computer Science Principles class. Instantly I was hooked with the challenge that
        <br> coding came with and the opportunity to work through problems. I find the fact that you can achieve almost anything
        <br> through code and how fascinating things can become over time and with a lot of practice.
